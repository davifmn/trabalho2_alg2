#These algorithms are heuristics and exact methods for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle (a path that visits all nodes exactly once and returns to the starting point).

1. Christofides Algorithm (Approximate, 1.5 Factor)
📌 Category: Approximation heuristic.
📌 Complexity: 
𝑂(𝑛3)
O(n 3).
📌 Approximation guarantee: At most 1.5 times the optimal cost.
🔹 Steps:
Generate a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): Connect nodes while minimizing total cost.
Identify odd-degree vertices in the MST.
Solve the Minimum Weight Matching problem (pairing these vertices at the lowest cost).
Combine the MST and matching edges, forming an Eulerian graph.
Find an Eulerian circuit and convert it into a Hamiltonian cycle, removing repeated nodes.
🔹 When to use it?

Useful for large instances where finding an exact solution is impractical.
Guarantees a near-optimal solution if edge weights satisfy the triangle inequality.
2. Twice-around-the-tree (Double Spanning Tree Tour)
📌 Category: Approximation heuristic.
📌 Complexity: 
𝑂(𝑛log𝑛).
📌 Approximation guarantee: At most 2 times the optimal cost.

🔹 Steps:
Construct a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
Traverse the MST twice (preorder depth-first search) to form an Eulerian circuit.
Convert this circuit into a Hamiltonian cycle by removing repeated visits.
🔹 When to use it?

Simple and efficient, but less accurate than Christofides.
Useful for large instances where speed is more important than precision.
3. Branch and Bound (Exact)
📌 Category: Exact method (guarantees optimal solution).
📌 Complexity: 
O(n!) in the worst case, but significantly reduced using pruning techniques.
📌 Not a heuristic, as it guarantees the optimal solution.

🔹 Steps:
Generate a search space containing all possible path permutations.
Apply a lower bound to discard suboptimal paths.
Expand only promising nodes, reducing the need to explore all combinations.
Prune bad solutions and keep refining until the optimal path is found.
🔹 When to use it?

Best suited for small instances (up to ~30 nodes).
Avoids exhaustive search by significantly reducing the number of cases analyzed.
